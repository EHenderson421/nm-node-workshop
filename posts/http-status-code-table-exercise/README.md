# HTTP Status Codes Table Exercise

Using this list of the official [HTTP status codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) and any other resources, build out an HTML table that describes each one. Each status code should include:

Take a screenshot of your table, upload it, and **submit the URL of your screenshot**.
