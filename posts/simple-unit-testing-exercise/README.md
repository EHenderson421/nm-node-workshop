# Simple Unit Testing Exercise

Complete the [Simple Unit Testing exercise](https://github.com/sikaeducation/simple-unit-testing). Note that there are *two* parts to the exercise: Writing the tests and refactoring the code. Fork and clone the repo, commit and push your changes, and **submit your public GitHub URL**, not the git URL.
